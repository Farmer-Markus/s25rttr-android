# s25rttr-android
Unofficial Android port of [s25client](https://github.com/Return-To-The-Roots/s25client).

I don't have any experience with android/java programming and much of the project is just a "temporary" solution.

Please DO NOT report bugs of the android port to the original [s25client](https://github.com/Return-To-The-Roots/s25client) github page or discord.

I've used the [sdl2 android example app](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2/android-project) as base of my rttr port.

I'm using android ndk r27 ndk r23(some dependencies are not compatible with ndk r17 :/) cmake 3.22.1 and openjdk 17.

Currently you need to put the settlers 2 data into the 'android-project/app/src/main/assets/share/s25rttr/S2' folder
